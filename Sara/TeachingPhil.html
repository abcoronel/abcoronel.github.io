       Wai’anae is one of the largest Native Hawaiian communities in O’ahu. It also has one of the lowest per capita income and the highest unemployment regions in the State. This community faces a lot of challenges that other lower-income communities face, such as complex trauma, domestic and substance abuse, and child maltreatment. It also has several additional problems, such as discrimination and historical trauma (Okihiro et al., 2017, p.160-161). Since there are a lot of obstacles the students have to face daily by living on one of the highest low-income areas on the island, I thought that it was essential to start introducing some positive skills that the students could use throughout their life. Therefore my teaching philosophy is based on creating a safe and brave environment for the students where they can learn strategies that they can use at home and in their lives in the future. To do this, I focus on teaching Habits of Mind and Growth Mindset. I incorporate Class Dojo videos such as the Empathy Unit or Perseverance Unit to teach different social-emotional skills.
       <br><br>


       I am also of the philosophy that intrinsic motivation is more valuable for a student than extrinsic motivation. Throughout my time teaching, I have moved from using the clip-up chart to focusing more on framing goals for the year. To shift to intrinsic motivation, I have set up different goals for the students in their reading, writing, and math classes. They know where they are and where they want to go. The students also have goal folders with charts to track their progress. Student tracking data is just as necessary as teacher tracking data because it allows the students to see their progress and feel motivated to keep on focusing in the classroom so that they can improve their scores. The use of tracking data aligns with Usher and Kober’s theory of mastery growth being critical to students’ success academically (2012).

       Due to my background in anthropology, I tend to lean towards culturally responsive teaching as much as possible. I do this by making sure to include Native Hawaiian values and language into the classroom discussions. I also create a space of learning where arts integration and moving around the classroom are an expectation. To me, I must meet every student. The past year I learned that the students that I have in the school need more time to work on projects and work with each other and less time just listening to a teacher lecture. Therefore I make it a priority to have lessons where we work on body portraits, painting, group work, and turn and talks so that each student can access the information taught.
       Indubitably, my main priority as an educator is to be able to give students access to information and skills that they can use to feel passionate and curious about their environment. I want to be able to help decrease the gap in inequity, and I hope that by differentiating learning through culturally relevant teachings, social, emotional learning instruction, and intrinsic motivation behavioral plans, I will be able to help my students.
